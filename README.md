# Forter Funny Bot Chat Room Challenge

## Start The Server
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`


# Functionality

A QNA chat: ask questions, and answer to others.
Sounds boring? Well, there is a bot in this chat that finds that very offensive!
The bot learns quickly and has a little bit of attitude, so... don't spam too much :)


# Description

1. Frontend:
	- JavaScript
	- angular.js
	- sockets.io
	- p5.js
	
2. Backend:
